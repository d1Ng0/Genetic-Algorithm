<p>This genetic algorithms teaches implements DNA which evolves over generations passing the information of the fittest to the following geneations so the flies learn to reach the target. <br />The existing GAs are founded upon the following main principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reproduction</li>
<li>Fitness</li>
<li>Crossover</li>
<li>Mutation</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a play at creating obstacles (by click and drag with the mouse pointer) and see how the flies evolve and eventually find a path. My work and study is based on ShiftMan and his awesome learning material "<a href="http://natureofcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature of Code</a>"</p>
