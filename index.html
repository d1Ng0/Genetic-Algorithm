<p>This genetic algorithm that implements DNA to evolves flies over generations passing the skills of the fittest to the following generation. The flies learn to reach the target by evolution.<br />
  The existing GAs are founded upon the following main principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reproduction</li>
<li>Fitness</li>
<li>Crossover</li>
<li>Mutation</li>
</ul>
<p>Some [WIP] code on <a href="https://github.com/d1Ng0/Genetic-Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genetic Algorithms</a>"</p>
<p>Have a play at creating obstacles (by click and drag with the mouse pointer) and see how the flies evolve and eventually find a path. My work and study is based on ShiftMan and his awesome learning material "<a href="http://natureofcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature of Code</a>"</p>
