  This genetic algorithms teaches implements DNA which evolves over generations passing the information of the fittest to the following geneations so the flies learn to reach the target.
  <br>The existing GAs are founded upon the following main principles:<br>
    Reproduction<br>
    Fitness<br>
    Crossover<br>
    Mutation<br>
  
Have a play at creating obstacles (by click and drag with the mouse pointer) and see how the flies evolve and eventually find a path.
