= Genetic Algorithm by TrainCode

Open the example in a new window:

https://d1ng0.github.io/Genetic-Algorithm/

In this example you see a genetic algorithm which learns how to reach the target. Each generation becomes aware of where to reach. 
You can draw obstacles on the screen by clicking and dragging the pointer.

My work and study is based on ShiftMan and his awesome learning material "Nature of Code" http://natureofcode.com
